# Kim_H_DragDrop


## Introduction

The pieces are to the left of the board, inside of the black box. Drag and drop pieces onto the board. Figure out which box to put the piece in.

When you are done with one puzzle, select one of the 4 options at the bottom of the page to choose a new puzzle. The pieces will be back in the box and changed to the new puzzle.
